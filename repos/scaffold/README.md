## Adding a new template

1. Add a directory in ./templates
2. Make sure the name is something that won't appear in your code e.g.
   go-lib-template
3. Everything inside the template directory with any styles of the template name
   (e.g. go-lib-template, goLibTemplate, go_lib_template) will get replaced by
   the project name when the user uses it.
